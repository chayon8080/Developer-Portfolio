            <h3>Web-developer</h3>
            <p>I study CSE at Daffodil international University.
                I'm a web developer.
                I spend my whole day, practically every day,
                experimenting with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript; dabbling with Python and Ruby;
                and inhaling a wide variety of potentially useless information through a few hundred RSS feeds.
                I build websites that delight and inform. I do it well. <br>
